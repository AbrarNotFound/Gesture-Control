# Gesture-Control

Gesture-Control is an innovative project that leverages computer vision and machine learning to recognize and interpret hand gestures, enabling users to control applications or devices through intuitive physical movements. This repository provides a robust framework for gesture detection, recognition, and integration with various interfaces, making it ideal for accessibility, automation, and creative interactive applications.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision libraries for accurate and fast gesture detection.
- **Customizable Gesture Set:** Easily add or modify gesture types to suit your application's needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Designed to work seamlessly on major operating systems.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean and extensible codebase for easy integration and expansion.
- **Demo Applications:** Example scripts to showcase gesture-based control in action.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- Webcam or camera device

### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Key libraries include OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy. See `requirements.txt` for the full list.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbrarNotFound/Gesture-Control.git
   cd Gesture-Control
   ```

2. **Run the Main Application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Interact**

   - Make gestures in front of your camera as defined in the supported gestures list.
   - The application will interpret your gestures and trigger the corresponding actions.

## Supported Gestures

- **Swipe Left / Right**
- **Thumbs Up / Down**
- **Open Palm / Fist**
- **Custom gestures** (see [Contributing](#contributing) for how to add your own)
